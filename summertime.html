                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
What can be inferred from the passage about the lifecycle of bumblebee?    
A.        The new workers are brought up by the male bees.
B.        Bumblebees hibernate throughout winter to survive.
C.        The virgin queens survive the summer and then continue the reproduction.
D.        All the bumblebee in a colony die when summer ends.
The continuation of the lifecycle depends on the skill of the queens in collecting food.</a>

At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter.

Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae.

The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose.

A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens.

Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants.

the Grasshopper
 The ants
were spending a fine winter's day drying grain 
collected in the summertime.
A
grasshopper, quite hungry, passed by and begged for a little food.The ants
asked him, "Why didn't you gather up food during the summer?"  He replied, "I as too busy having fun to
work. I passed the days singing." They then
said in mockery: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the  summer, you must dance without supper to bed
in the winter."
 Cerita 2The Koala and
The Kangaroo
  On the
first sunny day of summer Lulu the grey and cute koala and Bella the jumpy and
brown kangaroo had a nice sip at the cool, blue river.
"Hey
Lulu. Do you want to go on a race?", asked Bella. "Okay", said
Lulu with a certain feeling she would lose.
So they ran
the race and of course fast Bella won and Lulu was right for once.
About an
hour later Bella shouted at the top of her voice, "Let’s see who can touch
the top of that tree first".
"Okay,
but only if you don’t cheat", said Lulu. "I promise", said
Bella.
Because
Lulu was so determined, she climbed to the top faster than Bella could run.
Lulu was so happy that she closed her eyes while she jumped down the tree
saying "Yippy!" </a>

                                            Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
Which of the following statements about the passage is false?    
A.        When the colony has been thriving and reached a sufficient size, the queen will lay male eggs.
B.         Some female eggs are lied to produce new queens bees.
C.        The declining population of bumblebee has been attribute to the inadequate food resource.
D.        Nectar and pollen are still widely available even for the choosy species of bumblebees.
E.        A large percentage of the UK area has lost its ability to supply food for bumblebees.</a>

The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.

The Grasshopper saw them toiling away and asked why they were doing it. "Don't you know?" said one of the Ants. "The winter is coming and we need to store food so that we can survive." The Grasshopper laughed and said, "I don't need to worry about the winter. I can sing and dance all day and I'll be just fine." But when the cold weather came, the Grasshopper was hungry and cold and had to beg the Ants for food. They gave him some, but said, "You should have worked with us in the summer and then you would have had enough to eat."

A
grasshopper, quite hungry, passed by and begged for a little food.The ants
asked him, "Why didn't you gather up food during the summer?"  He replied, "I as too busy having fun to
work. I passed the days singing." They then
said in mockery: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the  summer, you must dance without supper to bed
in the winter."

The Kangaroo
  On the
first sunny day of summer Lulu the grey and cute koala and Bella the jumpy and
brown kangaroo had a nice sip at the cool, blue river.
"Hey
Lulu. Do you want to go on a race?", asked Bella. "Okay", said
Lulu with a certain feeling she would lose.
So they ran
the race and of course fast Bella won and Lulu was right for once.
About an
hour later Bella shouted at the top of her voice, "Let’s see who can touch
the top of that tree first".
"Okay,
but only if you don’t cheat", said Lulu. "I promise", said
Bella.
Because
Lulu was so determined, she climbed to the top faster than Bella could run.
Lulu was so happy that she closed her eyes while she jumped down the tree

                            16. Summer is a season which includes the hottest and longest days in a year, among the four seasons, in its cycle. As a result, summer, which falls between spring and autumn, has the shortest nights, albeit the summertime may vary among countries due to climate and tradition. When summer is coming, the days lengthen.
In most countries in the Northern hemisphere, summer starts in June and ends in September. Meanwhile, summer occurs in December, January, and February in southern hemisphere.
During summer, the days are usually bright so people go holidaying, swimming, or sunbathing on the beach. Vegetables and tropical fruits, such as pineapples, watermelons, mangoes, berries, and melons, are abundant in summer.
Among the four seasons, when does the summer fall?
(5 Poin)
A. Spring and autumn.
B. Autumn and winter.
C. Winter and spring
D. Longest nights in the year.
E. Shortest days in the year.</h2><br />

                            17. The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, thisslender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain,three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and manymore have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus distinguendus, for example, isnow restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shrill carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which wasonce common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition,
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leave thenest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make a new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch ofworkers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes hernest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein-rich fuel that is key to helping over-wintered queens tokickstart their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is a sugar-richfuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs anenzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers aredeveloped, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony hasbeen successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised asnew queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to theloss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast areas of suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been theavailability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar isavailable from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from,sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautifulbilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and birdâ€™s-foottrefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower-rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebeespecies.

I can sing and dance all day and I'll be just fine." But when the cold weather came, the Grasshopper was hungry and cold and had to beg the Ants for food. They gave him some, but said, "You should have worked with us in the summer and then you would have had enough to eat."

                            23. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species. 
Which of the following statements about the passage is false?    
A.        When the colony has been thriving and reached a sufficient size, the queen will lay male eggs.
B.         Some female eggs are lied to produce new queens bees.
C.        The declining population of bumblebee has been attribute to the inadequate food resource.
D.        Nectar and pollen are still widely available even for the choosy species of bumblebees.

                            29. Soal SImak UI Bahasa Inggris The unmistakable buzz of a bumblebee is one of the quintessential sounds of British summertime. However, this slender sound and faint utterance is under threat because bumblebees are in crisis. Of the 25 species native to Britain, three have already been declared extinct, five are designated UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority species, and many more have undergone major range contractions. The great yellow bumblebee, Bombus destinguendus, for example, is now restricted to northern Scotland, Orkney and the Hebrides, and the shirll carder bee, Bombus sylvarum, which was once common throughout southern Britain, now exists only in seven small groups. In addition, as these populations become more isolated they can become inbred, which increase the risk of further extinctions.
At the end of summer all the bumblebees in a colony die, apart from the virgin queens who mate and then leaves the nest to hibernate over winter. In the spring a queen will make new nest, lay eggs and then raise the first batch of workers. This annual cycle depends on there being enough pollen and nectar to sustain the queen as she establishes her nest and team of workers as the colony grows. Pollen is a protein rich fuel that is key to helping over wintered queens to kick start their reproductive systems ready and for the development of larvae. Nectar, on the other hand, is asugar rich fuel which is converted to honey to feed adult bees. The bees make honey by adding to the nectar in their honey sacs an enzyme called invertase, which converts sucrose sugars to a mixture of glucose and fructose. Once the workers are develop, they take over the foraging and the queen concentrates on laying eggs. Later in the year, if the colony has been successful and reaches a large enough size, the queen will produce male eggs and some female eggs are raised as new queens.
A lack of resources is thought to be the critical factor that is affecting bumblebee populations, and it is related to the loss of wild flowers, both in the countryside and in vast suburban gardens. The biggest impact has been the availability of food and drink, in particular the continuity of supplies throughout the colony cycle. Although nectar is available from a wide range of plants, the bees can be much more choosy about where they collect pollen from, sometimes restricting this to very few flowering plants. In Scotland, overwintered queens of the declining and beautiful bilberry bumblebee focus on bilberry in spring. Other species may focus on legumes such as red clover and bird’s foot trefoil. Sadly, because the UK has lost 98% of its flower rich grasslands, this has been devastating for some bumblebee species.
