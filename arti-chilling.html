I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one. It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation. I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy? While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him.

                                            minta tolong di translate ke bahasa indonesia yang jelas dan baik:The chilling survey of North Korea’s cyberpower in The Times, describing a sophisticated program of not only weapons of war but also of theft, blackmail, harassment and score-settling, is shocking, but not surprising. Kim Jong-un is ruthless in his quest for power and survival, and hacking, even more than the nuclear power North Korea is rapidly developing, is the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state.Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons pose an enormous threat to the United States and its Asian allies. But even a megalomaniac like Mr. Kim understands that unleashing them would spell a hellish end to him and his country. Cyberweapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses, as David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth detailed in their article. North Korea has used its army of hackers for assaults as diverse as multimillion-dollar digital bank robberies, the giant WannaCry ransomware attack (based on a secret tool stolen from the National Security Agency) and attacks on movie producers and television networks to force them to cancel projects deemed hostile by North Korea.Mr. Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult. North Korea is already under every possible international sanction, its infrastructure is too primitive for useful cyberretaliation, and neither the United States nor South Korea would likely launch a military attack. And North Korean hackers appear to operate largely outside the country, especially in China and India.</a>

                                            7	How to Make Strawberry Ice
Cream
Ingredients:
2 cups of heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 2/3 cups sugar, 1 bowl of strawberries.
Directions:
Wash and trim the caps of strawberries. Then, cut berries into slices that are approximately ¼ inch thick (or just use an egg slicer). Then, puree ½ of the sliced strawberries in a food processor or blender and set aside. Combine cream, milk, and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. After that, remove the mix from heat and pour it into a large bowl. Add in the strawberry puree and mix well. Next, cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until completely cool. While the custard is chilling, dice the remaining sliced strawberries into smaller pieces to mix in the ice cream. Then, freeze the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once the ice cream is done freezing, mix in the diced strawberries and pour it into an air-tight container. Finally, freeze for an additional 2 hours.

                                            January 27, 2013 I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one. It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation. I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy? While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine.

may be the best body temperature for fighting ageing. , it has long been held that the ideal human body temperature is a snug 37 degrees celsius. our bodies stick rigidly to it when healthy , and high fevers can be deadly . but a new study suggests that 36.5 celsius might be even better . mice cooled by half a degree below normal had a life expectancy 20 per sen  longer, or the equivalent of 7-8 additional human years. the result implies that chilling human blood could also stretch out or lifespan, if a safe way can be found to do it.
questions :
1. what is the ideal human body temperature ?
2. what temperature can be deadly ?
3. what happen to mice when their temperature is cooled by a half degree?
4. what does the result imply to human body ?</a>

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.       
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something.  I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
 I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes, I love him, but his being careless many times gets me annoyed, like this one. It was Monday afternoon at that time. I was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me to edit some photos from the last vacation. I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy? While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But, don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now. Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.” “Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I love him.

                            8. minta tolong di translate ke bahasa indonesia yang jelas dan baik:The chilling survey of North Korea’s cyberpower in The Times, describing a sophisticated program of not only weapons of war but also of theft, blackmail, harassment and score-settling, is shocking, but not surprising. Kim Jong-un is ruthless in his quest for power and survival, and hacking, even more than the nuclear power North Korea is rapidly developing, is the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state.Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons pose an enormous threat to the United States and its Asian allies. But even a megalomaniac like Mr. Kim understands that unleashing them would spell a hellish end to him and his country. Cyberweapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses, as David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth detailed in their article. North Korea has used its army of hackers for assaults as diverse as multimillion-dollar digital bank robberies, the giant WannaCry ransomware attack (based on a secret tool stolen from the National Security Agency) and attacks on movie producers and television networks to force them to cancel projects deemed hostile by North Korea.Mr. Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult. North Korea is already under every possible international sanction, its infrastructure is too primitive for useful cyberretaliation, and neither the United States nor South Korea would likely launch a military attack. And North Korean hackers appear to operate largely outside the country, especially in China and India.</h2><br />

Kim Jong-un adalah orang yang kejam dalam usahanya mencari kekuatan dan kelangsungan hidup, dan hacking, bahkan lebih dari sekedar kekuatan nuklir Korea Utara yang berkembang pesat, adalah senjata yang sempurna untuk sebuah negara kecil yang total, miskin, terisolasi, totaliter.<br /><br />Senjata nuklir Pyongyang merupakan ancaman besar bagi Amerika Serikat dan sekutunya di Asia. Tetapi bahkan megalomaniak seperti Mr Kim mengerti bahwa melepaskan mereka akan mengeja akhir yang mengerikan baginya dan negaranya. Sebaliknya, Cyberweapons menawarkan tingkat siluman dan penyangkalan dan penggunaan yang luas, seperti David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick dan Nicole Perlroth dalam artikel mereka. Korea Utara telah menggunakan tentaranya hacker untuk melakukan serangan yang beragam seperti perampokan bank digital bernilai jutaan dolar, serangan ransomware raksasa WannaCry (berdasarkan sebuah alat rahasia yang dicuri dari Badan Keamanan Nasional) dan serangan terhadap produsen film dan jaringan televisi untuk memaksa mereka ke membatalkan proyek yang dianggap bermusuhan oleh Korea Utara.<br /><br />Kontrol total Kim atas negaranya memberinya pilihan otak muda terbaik untuk dilatih sebagai hacker; biayanya relatif rendah, dan pembalasan efektif sejauh ini terbukti sangat sulit. Korea Utara sudah berada di bawah setiap sanksi internasional yang mungkin, infrastrukturnya terlalu primitif untuk cyberallaliation yang berguna, dan baik Amerika Serikat maupun Korea Selatan kemungkinan akan melancarkan serangan militer. Dan hacker Korea Utara tampaknya beroperasi sebagian besar di luar negeri, terutama di China dan India.<br /><br />Survei mengerikan terhadap cyberpower Korea Utara di The Times, yang menggambarkan sebuah program canggih tidak hanya senjata perang tapi juga pencurian, pemerasan, pelecehan dan penyelesaian nilai, mengejutkan, tapi tidak mengherankan.

Cream
Ingredients:
2 cups of heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 2/3 cups sugar, 1 bowl of strawberries.
Directions:
Wash and trim the caps of strawberries. Then, cut berries into slices that are approximately ¼ inch thick (or just use an egg slicer). Then, puree ½ of the sliced strawberries in a food processor or blender and set aside. Combine cream, milk, and sugar in a saucepan and heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. After that, remove the mix from heat and pour it into a large bowl. Add in the strawberry puree and mix well. Next, cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until completely cool. While the custard is chilling, dice the remaining sliced strawberries into smaller pieces to mix in the ice cream. Then, freeze the custard in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once the ice cream is done freezing, mix in the diced strawberries and pour it into an air-tight container. Finally, freeze for an additional 2 hours.

I jumped from my seat and grabbed my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised. There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what I did for her.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one. 
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.” “Where did you get it?” I asked him. He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked. I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied. 
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him. </h2><br />

my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week
ago, my auntie gave me more than enough for what
I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
 I tried to remember where I spent my money during the past week. I remembered
going to Jatim Park with my cousin, buying two tickets, two bowls of meatball soup, and two
glasses of iced lemon tea. That was all. What else did I buy?
While I was busy thinking, my cousin stepped out of the front door and called the
ice cream man. He looked at me and said, “Hey, wanna grab some ice cream? It’s on me.” And
I said to myself, “Well it’s free, so why not?” We both picked our ice cream and enjoyed it
while we were chilling out in the living room. I asked him “It is strange that you actually
treated me ice cream”. He shrugged his shoulder and said “That’s because I got some money
in my wallet.”  “Where did you get it?” I asked him.  He replied, “No idea, man. It was just
suddenly there.” “What? Let me see your wallet!” I shouted. Then, I opened it and learned
that the wallet was mine. I just remembered that we had the same wallets and they even had
the same color. “This is mine,” I told him. “No way! Are you sure?” he asked.  I showed him
a card from the wallet and said, “Look, this is my student ID card. Just a while ago I was
thinking why my money was all gone.” “Sorry, man. I didn’t know that it wasn’t mine. But,
don’t worry I haven’t bought anything with that. Only this ice cream,” He explained with an
innocent look. I took my wallet and said, “It is okay. I’m sorry you don’t have any cash now.
Here, take 20 thousands and buy some more ice cream with it. Oh, and here’s your wallet.”
“Cool! Thanks, man!” he replied.    
Yes, I hate his being careless. Fortunately, he is honest. Well, perhaps that’s why I
love him.

                        Saya memiliki perasaan campur aduk tentang sepupu saya. Ya, aku mencintainya, tapi sering kali dia membuatku kesal, seperti ini. Saat itu Senin siang waktu itu. Saya sedang menikmati acara TV ketika saya mendengar bel dari penjual es krim dari kejauhan. Itu mengingatkan saya pada sesuatu. Saya melompat dari kursi saya dan mengambil dompet saya. Saya membuka dompet saya, dan saya terkejut. Hanya ada beberapa rupiah di dalamnya. Seminggu yang lalu, bibi saya memberi saya lebih dari cukup untuk apa yang saya lakukan untuknya. Saya pandai komputer sehingga dia meminta saya mengedit beberapa foto dari liburan terakhir. Saya mencoba mengingat di mana saya menghabiskan uang saya selama seminggu terakhir. Saya ingat pergi ke Jatim Park bersama sepupuku, membeli dua tiket, dua mangkuk sup bakso, dan dua gelas es teh lemon. Itu saja. Apa lagi yang saya beli? Sementara saya sibuk berpikir, sepupu saya melangkah keluar dari pintu depan dan memanggil si es krim. Dia menatap saya dan berkata, “Hei, mau ambil es krim? Itu ada pada saya. ”Dan saya berkata pada diri sendiri,“ Yah itu gratis, jadi mengapa tidak? ”Kami berdua memilih es krim kami dan menikmatinya saat kami bersantai di ruang tamu. Saya bertanya kepadanya "Aneh bahwa Anda benar-benar memperlakukan saya dengan es krim". Dia mengangkat bahunya dan berkata, “Itu karena saya mendapatkan sejumlah uang di dompet saya.” “Di mana Anda mendapatkannya?” Saya bertanya kepadanya. Dia menjawab, “Tidak tahu, kawan. Tiba-tiba saja ada di sana. "" Apa? Biarkan aku melihat dompetmu! ”Teriakku. Kemudian, saya membukanya dan mengetahui bahwa dompet itu milik saya. Saya baru ingat bahwa kami memiliki dompet yang sama dan mereka bahkan memiliki warna yang sama. "Ini milikku," kataku padanya. "Tidak mungkin! Anda yakin? "Tanyanya. Saya menunjukkan kepadanya sebuah kartu dari dompet dan berkata, “Lihat, ini kartu pelajar saya. Beberapa saat yang lalu saya berpikir mengapa uang saya habis. "" Maaf, kawan. Saya tidak tahu bahwa itu bukan milik saya. Tapi, jangan khawatir saya belum membeli apa pun dengan itu. Hanya es krim ini, ”Dia menjelaskan dengan tampang polos. Saya mengambil dompet saya dan berkata, "Tidak apa-apa. Saya minta maaf Anda tidak punya uang tunai sekarang. Di sini, ambil 20 ribu dan beli es krim lagi dengannya. Oh, dan ini dompet Anda.

I have mixed feelings about my cousin. Yes,
I love him, but his being careless many times gets me
annoyed, like this one.
It was Monday afternoon at that time. I
was enjoying a TV show when I heard the bell of the
ice cream vendor from a distance. That reminded me
of something. I jumped from my seat and grabbed
my wallet. I opened my wallet, and I was surprised.
There were only a few rupiahs in it. Just a week

I did for her. I am good at computer so she asked me
to edit some photos from the last vacation.
