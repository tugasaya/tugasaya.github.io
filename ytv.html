Adults weigh from 60 – 120 pounds ( 27 – 55 kg ). Males are larger than females.    Snow Leopards have dark rosettes on a creamy white background, camouflaging them in the snow and rocks.

The tower is now the fifth-tallest structure in France and the tallest structure in Paris, with the second-tallest being the Tour Montparnasse (210 m-689 ft), although that will soon be surpassed by Tour AXA (225.11 m-738.36 ft)	The structure of the Eiffel Tower weighs 7,300 tons.

Adults weigh from 60 – 120 pounds ( 27 – 55 kg ). Males are larger than females.    Snow Leopards have dark rosettes on a creamy white background, camouflaging them in the snow and rocks.
