                                            The Story of Cindelaras
              Long time ago in the island of Java there was a kingdom named Jenggala Kingdom. The kingdom led by Raden Putra. He had a beautiful and kindconsort. He also had a beautiful concubine. Contrary to the queen, the concubine had bad personalities. She was jealous with the consort, so she planned to make the consort leave thepalace. By doing so, she could be the new consort.
           The concubine asked the palace physician to help her do her bad plan. The physician agreed to help her. They was implementing the plan they had.
      The concubine of the king pretended to severe pain. The palace physician immediately was called by the King. Afterchecking the concubine, the physician said that there wassomeone who had put poison in princess’ drink.
        “I am so sorry Your Majesty, there is none who are able to put the poison, except the consort.” said the physician. The king became angry to hear the explanation of the palace physician. Without thinking deeply and without checking thisinformation, he immediately ordered his soldiers to bring the queen to the jungle and kill her.  Soon the soldiers took her to the jungle.  But when they were there the soldiers took a pity on her.  They did not want to kill her because she was a kind and wise consort and at that time she was pregnant.  So they built a house and let the consort live there.  Then they broughtback to palace a deer’s heart to show the king that they had killed her.
       Arriving to the palace, the soldiers reported to the king that they had killed the consort by showing the heart of the deer. The King was satisfied when the soldiers reported that they had killed the consort.
       After a few months of being in the jungle, the consort born a boy. The child was named Cindelaras. Cindelaras grew into anintelligent and handsome boy. Since childhood he had been friends with some the animals.
        One day, when he was playing, an eagle dropped a chicken egg. Cindelaras then took the egg home and after 3 weeks, the eggs hatched. Cindelaras diligently maintained the chick. The chick grew into a strong cock. But there was one strange from the chicken. Crowing sound was different from the other cocks. “Kukuruyuk … lord Cindelaras, his house is in the middle of the jungle, the roof of palm leaves, and his father is Raden Putra …”, the crowing of the cock.
          Cindelaras was amazed to hear the crowing cock and ran back home, he immediately showed to his mother. Then, Cindelaras’ mother told the origin of why they were in the jungle. Listening the story from his mother, Cindelaras decided to go to the palace to meet the king and expose evil king’s concubine.
       After getting his mother’s permission, Cindelaras went to the palace accompanied by his cock. On his way, Cindelaras stopped at a village. There, he met some people who were involved in cockfighting. When they saw Cindelaras brought a cock, they challenged him to fight his cock with their cock.
       “If your cock wins, you’ll get a reward,” said one the men who challenged him. Cindelaras accepted the challenge. In a few minutes, his cock defeated the opponent’s cock. He was challenged again by other man, and one more time, his cock won. He won again and again.
       News about the strength of Cindelaras’ cock spread quickly up to the palace of Jenggala kingdom and it made Raden Putra was curious. So, he invited Cindelaras to the palace.
       “What is your name, boy?” Raden Putra asked when Cindelaras arrived in the palace. “My name is Cindelaras, Your Majesty,” Cindelaras answered. He felt happy to see Raden Putra.
       Raden Putra challenged Cindelaras with one condition. If Raden Putra’s cock won, Cindelaras’ head would be cut off. But if Cindelaras’ cock won, Raden Putra would share half of his wealth. Cindelaras accepted the condition. The competition was held in the front yard of the palace. The two cocks fought bravely. But in just a few minutes, Cindelaras’ cock won the fight! Raden Putra shook his head and stared at Cindelaras from his seat, “That cock is no ordinary cock, and the boy is not an ordinaty boy either. Who is he exactly?” he thought. Raden Putra was about to asked when suddenly Cindelaras’ cock was crowing, “Kukuruyuk … lord Cindelaras, his house is in the middle of the jungle, the roof of palm leaves, and his father is Raden Putra …”
       Raden Putra was surprised. “Is it true?” he asked. “Yes, Your Majesty. My name is Cindelaras and my mother was the consort,” said Cindelaras. Raden putra called the general of the soldiers who had banished the consort. The general then confessed that he never killed the queen. Later, the palace physician also admitted his mistake. Raden Putra was so shocked. He immediately went to the woods to pick up the consort. Ever since, Cindelaras and his parents lived happilytogether. As for the concubine, she was sent to the jail as punishment.

                            5. The Story of Cindelaras
              Long time ago in the island of Java there was a kingdom named Jenggala Kingdom. The kingdom led by Raden Putra. He had a beautiful and kindconsort. He also had a beautiful concubine. Contrary to the queen, the concubine had bad personalities. She was jealous with the consort, so she planned to make the consort leave thepalace. By doing so, she could be the new consort.
           The concubine asked the palace physician to help her do her bad plan. The physician agreed to help her. They was implementing the plan they had.
      The concubine of the king pretended to severe pain. The palace physician immediately was called by the King. Afterchecking the concubine, the physician said that there wassomeone who had put poison in princess’ drink.
        “I am so sorry Your Majesty, there is none who are able to put the poison, except the consort.” said the physician. The king became angry to hear the explanation of the palace physician. Without thinking deeply and without checking thisinformation, he immediately ordered his soldiers to bring the queen to the jungle and kill her.  Soon the soldiers took her to the jungle.  But when they were there the soldiers took a pity on her.  They did not want to kill her because she was a kind and wise consort and at that time she was pregnant.  So they built a house and let the consort live there.  Then they broughtback to palace a deer’s heart to show the king that they had killed her.
       Arriving to the palace, the soldiers reported to the king that they had killed the consort by showing the heart of the deer. The King was satisfied when the soldiers reported that they had killed the consort.
       After a few months of being in the jungle, the consort born a boy. The child was named Cindelaras. Cindelaras grew into anintelligent and handsome boy. Since childhood he had been friends with some the animals.
        One day, when he was playing, an eagle dropped a chicken egg. Cindelaras then took the egg home and after 3 weeks, the eggs hatched. Cindelaras diligently maintained the chick. The chick grew into a strong cock. But there was one strange from the chicken. Crowing sound was different from the other cocks. “Kukuruyuk … lord Cindelaras, his house is in the middle of the jungle, the roof of palm leaves, and his father is Raden Putra …”, the crowing of the cock.
          Cindelaras was amazed to hear the crowing cock and ran back home, he immediately showed to his mother. Then, Cindelaras’ mother told the origin of why they were in the jungle. Listening the story from his mother, Cindelaras decided to go to the palace to meet the king and expose evil king’s concubine.
       After getting his mother’s permission, Cindelaras went to the palace accompanied by his cock. On his way, Cindelaras stopped at a village. There, he met some people who were involved in cockfighting. When they saw Cindelaras brought a cock, they challenged him to fight his cock with their cock.
       “If your cock wins, you’ll get a reward,” said one the men who challenged him. Cindelaras accepted the challenge. In a few minutes, his cock defeated the opponent’s cock. He was challenged again by other man, and one more time, his cock won. He won again and again.
       News about the strength of Cindelaras’ cock spread quickly up to the palace of Jenggala kingdom and it made Raden Putra was curious. So, he invited Cindelaras to the palace.
       “What is your name, boy?” Raden Putra asked when Cindelaras arrived in the palace. “My name is Cindelaras, Your Majesty,” Cindelaras answered. He felt happy to see Raden Putra.
       Raden Putra challenged Cindelaras with one condition. If Raden Putra’s cock won, Cindelaras’ head would be cut off. But if Cindelaras’ cock won, Raden Putra would share half of his wealth. Cindelaras accepted the condition. The competition was held in the front yard of the palace. The two cocks fought bravely. But in just a few minutes, Cindelaras’ cock won the fight! Raden Putra shook his head and stared at Cindelaras from his seat, “That cock is no ordinary cock, and the boy is not an ordinaty boy either. Who is he exactly?” he thought. Raden Putra was about to asked when suddenly Cindelaras’ cock was crowing, “Kukuruyuk … lord Cindelaras, his house is in the middle of the jungle, the roof of palm leaves, and his father is Raden Putra …”
       Raden Putra was surprised. “Is it true?” he asked. “Yes, Your Majesty. My name is Cindelaras and my mother was the consort,” said Cindelaras. Raden putra called the general of the soldiers who had banished the consort. The general then confessed that he never killed the queen. Later, the palace physician also admitted his mistake. Raden Putra was so shocked. He immediately went to the woods to pick up the consort. Ever since, Cindelaras and his parents lived happilytogether. As for the concubine, she was sent to the jail as punishment.

Dia memiliki pendamping yang cantik dan baik hati.  Dia juga memiliki selir yang cantik.  Bertentangan dengan ratu, selir itu memiliki kepribadian yang buruk.  Dia cemburu dengan permaisuri, jadi dia berencana untuk membuat permaisuri meninggalkan istana.

Raja menjadi marah mendengar penjelasan tabib istana.  Tanpa berpikir panjang dan tanpa mengecek informasi ini, dia langsung memerintahkan tentaranya untuk membawa ratu ke hutan dan membunuhnya.  Segera tentara membawanya ke hutan.  Tetapi ketika mereka berada di sana, para tentara merasa kasihan padanya.  Mereka tidak ingin membunuhnya karena dia adalah seorang permaisuri yang baik dan bijaksana dan pada saat itu dia sedang hamil.  Jadi mereka membangun rumah dan membiarkan permaisuri tinggal di sana.  Kemudian mereka membawa kembali ke istana hati rusa untuk menunjukkan kepada raja bahwa mereka telah membunuhnya.</p><p> Sesampainya di istana, para prajurit melapor kepada raja bahwa mereka telah membunuh permaisuri dengan menunjukkan hati rusa.  Raja merasa puas ketika tentara melaporkan bahwa mereka telah membunuh permaisuri.</p><p> Setelah beberapa bulan berada di hutan, sang permaisuri melahirkan seorang anak laki-laki.  Anak itu bernama Cindelaras.  Cindelaras tumbuh menjadi anak yang cerdas dan tampan.  Sejak kecil dia sudah berteman dengan beberapa binatang.</p><p></p><p> Suatu hari, saat sedang bermain, seekor elang menjatuhkan sebutir telur ayam.  Cindelaras kemudian membawa pulang telur tersebut dan setelah 3 minggu, telur tersebut menetas.  Cindelaras dengan rajin memelihara ayam itu.  Anak ayam itu tumbuh menjadi ayam jantan yang kuat.  Tapi ada satu yang aneh dari ayam itu.  Suara kokok ayam pun berbeda dengan ayam lainnya.  “Kukuruyuk… Tuan Cindelaras, rumahnya di tengah hutan, atapnya daun lontar, dan ayahnya adalah Raden Putra…”, kokok ayam.</p><p> Cindelaras takjub mendengar kokok ayam itu dan berlari pulang, ia langsung menunjukkannya pada ibunya.  Kemudian, ibu Cindelaras menceritakan asal muasal mengapa mereka berada di hutan.  Mendengarkan cerita dari ibunya, Cindelaras memutuskan untuk pergi ke istana untuk bertemu raja dan mengungkap selir raja jahat.</p><p> Setelah mendapat ijin ibunya, Cindelaras pergi ke istana ditemani kemaluannya.  Dalam perjalanannya, Cindelaras berhenti di sebuah desa.  Di sana, ia bertemu dengan beberapa orang yang terlibat adu ayam.  Ketika mereka melihat Cindelaras membawa ayam, mereka menantangnya untuk melawan ayamnya dengan ayam mereka.</p><p> "Jika ayam Anda menang, Anda akan mendapat hadiah," kata salah satu pria yang menantangnya.  Cindelaras menerima tantangan itu.  Dalam beberapa menit, kemaluannya berhasil mengalahkan ayam lawan.  Dia ditantang lagi oleh pria lain, dan sekali lagi, kemaluannya menang.  Dia menang lagi dan lagi.</p><p> Berita tentang kekuatan ayam Cindelaras dengan cepat menyebar hingga ke istana kerajaan Jenggala dan membuat Raden Putra penasaran.  Jadi, dia mengundang Cindelaras ke istana.</p><p> "Siapa namamu, Nak?"  Raden Putra bertanya kapan Cindelaras tiba di istana.  “Nama saya Cindelaras, Yang Mulia,” jawab Cindelaras.  Dia merasa senang melihat Raden Putra.</p><p> Raden Putra menantang Cindelaras dengan satu syarat.  Jika ayam Raden Putra menang, kepala Cindelaras akan dipotong.  Namun jika ayam Cindelaras menang, Raden Putra akan membagi sebagian kekayaannya.  Cindelaras menerima syarat tersebut.  Lomba diadakan di halaman depan istana.  Kedua ayam itu bertarung dengan gagah berani.  Tapi hanya dalam beberapa menit, ayam Cindelaras memenangkan pertarungan!  Raden Putra menggelengkan kepalanya dan menatap Cindelaras dari tempat duduknya, “Ayam itu bukan ayam biasa, dan anak laki-laki itu juga bukan anak laki-laki biasa.  Siapa dia sebenarnya? ”  dia pikir.  Raden Putra hendak bertanya ketika tiba-tiba ayam Cindelaras berkokok, “Kukuruyuk… Tuanku Cindelaras, rumahnya di tengah hutan, atap daun lontar, dan ayahnya adalah Raden Putra…”</p><p> Raden Putra kaget.  Apakah itu benar?  Dia bertanya.  "Ya yang Mulia.  Namaku Cindelaras dan ibuku adalah pendampingnya, ”kata Cindelaras.  Raden putra memanggil jenderal prajurit yang telah mengusir permaisuri.  Jenderal kemudian mengaku bahwa dia tidak pernah membunuh ratu.  Belakangan, tabib istana juga mengakui kesalahannya.  Raden Putra sangat kaget.  Dia segera pergi ke hutan untuk menjemput permaisuri.  Sejak saat itu, Cindelaras dan orang tuanya hidup bahagia bersama.  Sedangkan untuk selir, dia dikirim ke penjara sebagai hukumlah</p><br />
