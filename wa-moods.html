After the roots grow, they are put into 6 inch pots. The soil in the pots should be kept moist but possible for the water to go through it for optimum growth.There are some important advantages of Jasmine. In medication, this flower is often used for soothing headaches, stimulating brain, and restoring balance. Its extract is also widely used in the making of perfume.​</a>

When our two souls stand up erect and strong,  
Face to face, silent, drawing nigh and nigher,  
Until the lengthening wings break into fire  
At either curvèd point,—what bitter wrong  
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long 
Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,  
The angels would press on us and aspire  
To drop some golden orb of perfect song  
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay  
Rather on earth, Belovèd,—where the unfit 
Contrarious moods of men recoil away  
And isolate pure spirits, and permit  
A place to stand and love in for a day,  
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.</a>

                                            sebutkan Past Tense yang ada pada kalimat dibawah ini. Everyone’s first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course, we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling.
When I was about sixteen years old, I wanted to buy albums from my favorite bands, but I did not have any money. My parents were not the type of people to give money to me out of nowhere, or even for work done at home. I had to find work in order to purchase the music I 
 wanted.
So, I inquired as to who could give me work around town. I lived in the town of Woodway, which was relatively small, with no street lights, and hardly any population. But my neighborhood, Twin Maples, had enough people, especially elderly people, that needed help in their yards. I went to the oldest person I knew in my neighborhood, Mrs. Hudson. She was over eighty years old, and could not tend her garden anymore. She had flowers, a grass lawn, and 
some tomato plants. I knocked on her door, building up enough courage to ask her for work. 
 She answered that indeed she needed help in her garden. She did not discuss the amount of 
money I would get for the work.
My first job was to pull out weeds. I got down on my knees with foam protectors and began to pull out weeds one by one in her front yard and backyard. After this tedious task, I mowed her 
lawn—front and back. That was it for my first day, and it took me about two hours. I asked her much I would get paid, and she said, “I will give you $5 an hour. I don’t know much people are paid these days, anyways.” It was less than I thought I would get paid, but at least I had a job.
After getting that $10, I walked the few miles to the supermarket at the top of the hill, above the Puget Sound. I went to the electronics section of the supermarket, and bought an album from the band “Tool,” which was extremely popular at that time. It was dark and richly-layered alternative rock music with sinister lyrics: the type of music teenagers enjoys.
One of my favorite hobbies was to lay on my lawn with two computer speakers between my ears and to listen to music with all of its nuances, moods, and atmospheres. This, and taking in the fresh air of the woods around me, was a sort of bliss. That is why I worked: to make these moments even more rapturous with more music.
 After many days of working for Mrs. Hudson, and buying more CDs, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to save money for something even more interesting than music: a Gameboy. Gameboys at this time were all the rage, so it was natural for me to yearn for it. I started to work for multiple clients, so to say, in order to earn enough money to purchase this prized. When I gathered enough money to buy a Gameboy (it was about $100 at that time), I went out to a shop and bought a shiny red one, and one game to play on it. However, after one day of 
playing on it, I realized that I had made a mistake: it was not as fun as I thought it was going to be, and I felt like I wasted my money. I sweated in the hot sun for hours doing yard work to buy something I did not want. So, the next day, I returned it for a full refund. From then on, I bought only music albums with my money.
I think everyone should get on one’s knees and pull weeds. I believe everyone should at least once work for an elderly person, and help him or her take care of his or her garden. I think everyone should feel the searing sun on one’s back as they mow grass. It seems these 
experiences harden our spirits and resolve, and make us more in touch with the earth. Besides this, a first job like this supplies you with the value of money, as sweat turned into cash is something no can take away from you.Thank you​</a>

It's hard to believe that spring
Is here so soon and I've been gone so long
Keep sending your letters on
Memories of home are still
Haunting my days and I am losing my way
High tide, changing moods
Familiar face I know
High tide, changing light
Familiar place I'll go
Keep playing out favourite song
Cause sometimes I sing it so loud
I'm praying that you might hear
And sing along
Days turning from sweet to dry
Memories home are still
Haunting my days and I'll wait for your reply
High tide, changing moods

                                            The Importance of Exercise for Our HealthHave you ever heard the expression "use it or lose it"? It's true! If you don't use your body, you will surely lose it. If you don't exercise, your muscles will become flabby and weak. Your heart and lungs won't function eciently. And your joints will be stiff and easily injured. Inactivity is as much of a health risk as smoking!Helps Prevent DiseasesOur bodies were meant to be active. They actually crave exercise. Regular exercise is necessary for physical fitness and good health. It reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood, diabetes, and other diseases.it can improve your appearance and delay the aging process.Improves StaminaWhen you exercise, your body uses energy to keep going. Aerobic exercise involves continuous and rhythmic physical motion, such as walking and bicycling. It improves your stamina by training your body to become more efficient and use less energy for the same amount of work. As your conditioning level improves, your heart rate and breathing rate return to resting levels much sooner from strenuous activity.Strengthens and TonesExercising with weights and other forms of resistance training develops your muscles, bones and ligaments for increased strength and endurance. Your posture can be improved, and your muscles become more rm and toned. You not only feel better, but you look better, too!Enhances FlexibilityStretching exercises are also important for good posture. They keep your body limber so that you can bend, reach and twist. Improving your exibility through exercise reduces the chance of injury and improves balance and coordination. If you have stiff, tense areas, such as the upper back or neck, performing specicstretches can help "loosen" those muscles, helping you feel more relaxed.Controls WeightExercise is also a key to weight control because it burns calories. If you burn off more calories than you take in, you lose weight. It's as simple. Improve Quality of LifeOnce you begin to exercise regularly, you will discover many more reasons why exercise is so important to improving the quality of your life. Exercise reduces stress, lifts moods, and helps you sleep better. It can keep you looking and feeling younger throughout your entire life.All in all, exercise is important to make us feel better, have more energy, and perhaps even live longer.1.

When our two souls stand up erect and strong,

Until the lengthening wings break into fire  
At either curvèd point,—what bitter wrong  
Can the earth do to us, that we should not long 
Be here contented? Think. In mounting higher,  
The angels would press on us and aspire  
To drop some golden orb of perfect song  
Into our deep, dear silence. Let us stay  
Rather on earth, Belovèd,—where the unfit 
Contrarious moods of men recoil away  
And isolate pure spirits, and permit  
A place to stand and love in for a day,  
With darkness and the death-hour rounding it.</h2><br />

                            7. sebutkan Past Tense yang ada pada kalimat dibawah ini. Everyone’s first job is special. There are a couple of reasons for this: the experience is burned in one’s memory, it gives you the practice needed to fulfill other positions, and it teaches you about the value of money. Of course, we do jobs around the house when we are young, like cleaning dishes, vacuuming, and doing laundry, but working for others for money gives off a different feeling.
When I was about sixteen years old, I wanted to buy albums from my favorite bands, but I did not have any money. My parents were not the type of people to give money to me out of nowhere, or even for work done at home. I had to find work in order to purchase the music I 
 wanted.
So, I inquired as to who could give me work around town. I lived in the town of Woodway, which was relatively small, with no street lights, and hardly any population. But my neighborhood, Twin Maples, had enough people, especially elderly people, that needed help in their yards. I went to the oldest person I knew in my neighborhood, Mrs. Hudson. She was over eighty years old, and could not tend her garden anymore. She had flowers, a grass lawn, and 
some tomato plants. I knocked on her door, building up enough courage to ask her for work. 
 She answered that indeed she needed help in her garden. She did not discuss the amount of 
money I would get for the work.
My first job was to pull out weeds. I got down on my knees with foam protectors and began to pull out weeds one by one in her front yard and backyard. After this tedious task, I mowed her 
lawn—front and back. That was it for my first day, and it took me about two hours. I asked her much I would get paid, and she said, “I will give you $5 an hour. I don’t know much people are paid these days, anyways.” It was less than I thought I would get paid, but at least I had a job.
After getting that $10, I walked the few miles to the supermarket at the top of the hill, above the Puget Sound. I went to the electronics section of the supermarket, and bought an album from the band “Tool,” which was extremely popular at that time. It was dark and richly-layered alternative rock music with sinister lyrics: the type of music teenagers enjoys.
One of my favorite hobbies was to lay on my lawn with two computer speakers between my ears and to listen to music with all of its nuances, moods, and atmospheres. This, and taking in the fresh air of the woods around me, was a sort of bliss. That is why I worked: to make these moments even more rapturous with more music.
 After many days of working for Mrs. Hudson, and buying more CDs, I came to the conclusion that I wanted to save money for something even more interesting than music: a Gameboy. Gameboys at this time were all the rage, so it was natural for me to yearn for it. I started to work for multiple clients, so to say, in order to earn enough money to purchase this prized. When I gathered enough money to buy a Gameboy (it was about $100 at that time), I went out to a shop and bought a shiny red one, and one game to play on it. However, after one day of 
playing on it, I realized that I had made a mistake: it was not as fun as I thought it was going to be, and I felt like I wasted my money. I sweated in the hot sun for hours doing yard work to buy something I did not want. So, the next day, I returned it for a full refund. From then on, I bought only music albums with my money.
I think everyone should get on one’s knees and pull weeds. I believe everyone should at least once work for an elderly person, and help him or her take care of his or her garden. I think everyone should feel the searing sun on one’s back as they mow grass. It seems these 
experiences harden our spirits and resolve, and make us more in touch with the earth. Besides this, a first job like this supplies you with the value of money, as sweat turned into cash is something no can take away from you.Thank you​</h2><br />

It's hard to believe that spring
Is here so soon and I've been gone so long
Keep sending your letters on
Memories of home are still
Haunting my days and I am losing my way
High tide, changing moods
Familiar face I know
High tide, changing light
Familiar place I'll go
Keep playing out favourite song
Cause sometimes I sing it so loud
I'm praying that you might hear
And sing along
Days turning from sweet to dry
Memories home are still
Haunting my days and I'll wait for your reply
High tide, changing moods

High tide, changing light
Familiar place I'll go

                            19. The Importance of Exercise for Our HealthHave you ever heard the expression "use it or lose it"? It's true! If you don't use your body, you will surely lose it. If you don't exercise, your muscles will become flabby and weak. Your heart and lungs won't function eciently. And your joints will be stiff and easily injured. Inactivity is as much of a health risk as smoking!Helps Prevent DiseasesOur bodies were meant to be active. They actually crave exercise. Regular exercise is necessary for physical fitness and good health. It reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer, high blood, diabetes, and other diseases.it can improve your appearance and delay the aging process.Improves StaminaWhen you exercise, your body uses energy to keep going. Aerobic exercise involves continuous and rhythmic physical motion, such as walking and bicycling. It improves your stamina by training your body to become more efficient and use less energy for the same amount of work. As your conditioning level improves, your heart rate and breathing rate return to resting levels much sooner from strenuous activity.Strengthens and TonesExercising with weights and other forms of resistance training develops your muscles, bones and ligaments for increased strength and endurance. Your posture can be improved, and your muscles become more rm and toned. You not only feel better, but you look better, too!Enhances FlexibilityStretching exercises are also important for good posture. They keep your body limber so that you can bend, reach and twist. Improving your exibility through exercise reduces the chance of injury and improves balance and coordination. If you have stiff, tense areas, such as the upper back or neck, performing specicstretches can help "loosen" those muscles, helping you feel more relaxed.Controls WeightExercise is also a key to weight control because it burns calories. If you burn off more calories than you take in, you lose weight. It's as simple. Improve Quality of LifeOnce you begin to exercise regularly, you will discover many more reasons why exercise is so important to improving the quality of your life. Exercise reduces stress, lifts moods, and helps you sleep better. It can keep you looking and feeling younger throughout your entire life.All in all, exercise is important to make us feel better, have more energy, and perhaps even live longer.1.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Garis
</p><p>
</p><p>Garis adalah tanda untuk menghubungkan dua titik. Berbagai jenis garis muncul di mana-mana. Lihatlah di sekitar Anda dan Anda akan melihat baris yang lurus, lengkung, berbelok-belok, tipis, tebal, dan titik-titik.
</p><p>
</p><p>Garis dapat digunakan untuk:
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Mengatur informasi.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Penekanan kata.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Menghubungkan informasi.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Outline foto .
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Membuat kotak.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Membuat bagan atau grafik.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Membuat pola atau ritme dengan membuat banyak baris.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Membuat penekanan langsung ke mata pembaca. (Membuat garis diagonal.)
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Mensugesti emosi.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ilustrasi
</p><p>
</p><p>Merupakan unsur grafis yang sangat vital dan dapat disajikan mulai dari goresan atau titik sederhana sampai dengan kompleks. Ilstrasi berfungsi untuk :
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Menarik perhatian
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Merangsang minat pembaca terhadap keseluruhan pesan
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Memberikan ekplanasi atas pernyataan
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Menonjolkan keistimewaan daripada produk
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Memenangkan persaingan
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Menciptakan suasana khas  </p><p>
</p><p>-          Dramatisasi pesan
</p><p>
</p><p>-          Menonjolkan suatu merk atau semboyan dan mendukung judul iklan
</p><p>
</p><p>Ilustrasi dapat berupa gambar, foto, maupun garfis lainnya. Gambar merupakan penjelasan yang dapat menerjemahkan isi iklan secara menyelururh, mempu menarik perhatian sekaligus menangkap pandangan secara sepintas. Ilustrasi dapat dihasilkan melalui beberapa teknik, yaitu :
</p><p>
</p><p>Gambar Tangan (Hand Drawing)
</p><p>
</p><p>Ilustrasi gambar tangan dibuat secara keseluruhan menggunakan tangan, dengan memberikan ekspresi dan karakter tertentu untuk mendukung media komunikasi grafis yang dibuat, seperti iklan, poster, baliho, dan sebagainya.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tipografi
</p><p>
</p><p>Tipografi merupakan seni dalam merancang, menyusun dan memodifikasi huruf. Tipografi melibatkan beberapa pengaturan pada huruf seperti ukuran huruf, jenis huruf, tracking (jarak antar huruf secara umum), kerning (jarak antar dua huruf yang spesifik), dan leading (jarak antar baris).
</p><p>
</p><p>Warna
</p><p>
</p><p>Warna dalam layout dapat menyampaikan moods, membuat gambar, menarik perhatian, dan mengidentifikasi objek. Ketika memilih warna untuk publikasi atau halaman web, tentang apa yang ingin Anda lakukan dan ke warna apa yang cocok untuk tujuan anda.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>•       Sorot elemen penting dan utama seperti subheads.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Menarik mata.

</p><p>•       Bersama kelompok elemen atau mengisolasi mereka.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Memprovokasi emosi.
</p><p>
</p><p>Gelap terang
</p><p>
</p><p>Salah satu cara terbaik untuk memudahkan unsur penangkapan pesan dalam visual grafis adalah dengan mengatur gelap dan terangnya. Ada dua pembagian dalam kategori ini, yaitu Low Contrast Value yang berarti penggunaan warna-warna yang kurang kontras. Visual yang dihasilkan akan cenderung kalem, statis, dan sederhana serta tenang. Sedangkan yang kedua adalah High Contrast Value, yaitu penggunaan warna-warna kontras dengan ekstrim, sehingga menghasilkan visual yang enerjik, ceria, dinamis, dramatis, dan penuh gairah.
</p><p>
</p><p>Berdasarkan nilai dalam gelap dan terangnya, warna dibagi menjadi beberapa tingkatan. Paling terang adalah warna putih, kemudian warna tergelap adalah hitam.
</p><p>
</p><p>Aturannya, warna gelap akan terbaca jika ditempatkan pada background terang.
</p><p>
</p><p>Begitu pula sebaliknya, warna terang akan sangat mudah terbaca jika ditempatkan pada backgroundgelap.
</p><p>
</p><p>Tekstur
</p><p>
</p><p>Tekstur merupakan nilai raba atau lebih mudahnya adalah halus dan kasarnya sebuah permukaan benda. Dalam desain grafis, penggunaan tekstur dapat dimayakan untuk memberikan visual yang lebih berkarakter.

</p><p>
</p><p>•       Memberikan publikasi cetak, presentasi, atau halaman web yang mood atau kepribadian.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Kontras untuk membuat bunga.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>•       Memprovokasi emosi.
</p><p>
</p><p>•       Membuat rasa kekayaan dan mendalam

                            23. Jasmine Jasmine is an evergreen semi-vining shrub native to tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Africa and Australia. The plants are usually up to 3 meters high and 2 meters wide. Jasmine is a climbing vine with oval, shiny leaves and tubular, waxy-white flowers. It has small white star-shaped flowers. The Jasmine flower releases its fragrance at night after the sun has set and especially when the moon is waxing towards fullness, thus it is associated with soothing peaceful night-time moods.
